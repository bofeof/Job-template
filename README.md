# Job list with filtering data

The main aim of project is to practice React, Js, Redux.
Filters depend on which badges you have chosen, remove and add filters and see how your screen with vacancies changes. At this moment the data is taken from the mock json file, there is no server part.

Inspired by challenge: [Job listings with filtering](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/job-listings-with-filtering-ivstIPCt)

Run locally:

    `start`: react-scripts start
    `build`: react-scripts build
